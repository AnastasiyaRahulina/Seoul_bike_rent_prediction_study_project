# Seoul_bike_rent_prediction_study_project
This repository contains study project on classical ML-algorithms/modelling. Models used for prediction include: lin_regression, Random Forest, Greadient Boosting, XGBoost. All models was tuned and validated (usin GridSerch, HyperOpt) and a total r2 score of 0.94 achieved.
Extensive EDA and data preperation. For cyclic data used sin/cos encoding.
